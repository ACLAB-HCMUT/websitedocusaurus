# Agricultural Electrical Cabinet Control Program
## Program to Test Operation of 32-Channel Modbus RTU Relay
---
This program is designed to test the functionality of each channel on the 32-channel Modbus RTU relay module. It will sequentially toggle each relay to ensure proper operation.

Code 
```python


```

Explanation:
- Initialize Modbus Communication: Set up the Modbus communication with the relay module.
- Sequential Relay Control: Loop through all 32 channels, toggling each relay on and off with a 1-second delay.
